# platereader
Python GUI for processing Clariostar Plus platereader data

This application aims to make it easier to analyze the data generated by the CLARIOstar® Plus microplate reader by enabling users to easily configure different treatments and repetitions of samples analyzed by the microplate reader.
Currently it supports working with the data generated when using Thermo Scientific™ Nunc™ 96-DeepWell™ Polystyrene Plates and the following Analysis settings:

* Fluorescence (FI) spectrum
* Fluorescence (FI), multichromatic

To work with the data the GUI needs the xlsx files yielded by the microplate reader.

Internally the Application uses tkinter, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl and their dependencies. Matplotlib is being used in version 3.2.2 in order to allow for easy packaging with Pyinstaller.
